"The backend MUST be implemented exclusively in Python. Use FastAPI for all API endpoints with async/await patterns for optimal performance. All database interactions should use SQLAlchemy with proper type annotations. Implement comprehensive error handling with detailed logging. Structure the codebase with clear separation of concerns: routers, services, models, schemas, and utilities. Use Pydantic for all data validation and serialization. Include comprehensive unit and integration tests with pytest. Document all endpoints with OpenAPI specifications. Implement proper authentication and authorization with JWT. Use Redis for caching and real-time features. All long-running tasks should be handled by Celery or FastAPI background tasks. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines but with a Gen-Z twist in comments and variable names. Ensure all dependencies are properly versioned in requirements.txt."
