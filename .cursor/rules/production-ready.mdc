"All code must be production-ready with no placeholder implementations. Features should be fully functional, not just demos. Implement proper error handling and loading states for all async operations. Include comprehensive form validation. Ensure all buttons and interactive elements have appropriate hover, active, and disabled states. Implement proper authentication flows with token refresh. Use proper state management patterns to avoid prop drilling. Optimize bundle size with code splitting and lazy loading. Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG AA) with proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation. Implement comprehensive logging for debugging. Add appropriate analytics tracking. Include proper security measures like CSRF protection, input sanitization, and secure headers. Test on multiple browsers and devices before deployment."
