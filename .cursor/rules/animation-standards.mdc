"All UI animations must be smooth, purposeful, and enhance the F1 racing experience. Use Framer Motion for React component animations. Ensure animations have appropriate easing functions - prefer cubic-bezier curves that mimic racing acceleration/deceleration. Animations should complete within 300-800ms for optimal UX. Include animations for page transitions, button interactions, data updates, and loading states. All animations must be performant (60fps) and not cause layout shifts. Provide reduced-motion alternatives for accessibility. Use racing-inspired visual effects like speed lines, motion blur, and particle effects where appropriate."
